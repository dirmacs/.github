# DIRMACS

**Democratizing Innovation through Resource Mobility and Access Creation for Sustainability** — building the future with AI-powered solutions.

DIRMACS is an organization focused on making advanced AI infrastructure accessible, sustainable, and practical. We care about resource mobility (moving compute and capability where it matters), access (open-source building blocks anyone can use and extend), and sustainability (systems that run reliably and improve over time). We build in the open, in Rust, and with a clear belief that the future of work is human and agent together — not one replacing the other.

## What we do

We build open-source Rust infrastructure for agentic AI: long-horizon workflows, systems that run 24/7, and a stack where the human in the loop, agents, tools, and skills work as one. We're not just chasing intelligence — we're building the infrastructure that builds itself. Our public repos give you the core pieces (servers, execution context, search, MCP); we run our own agent on top of that stack and keep improving it from real use.

## Projects

We link only **public** repositories below. Do not add private or internal repos here.

- **[ares](https://github.com/dirmacs/ares)** — Production-grade agentic chatbot server with multi-provider LLM support, tool calling, RAG, and MCP integration.
- **[thulp](https://github.com/dirmacs/thulp)** — Execution Context Engineering Platform for AI agents.
- **[daedra](https://github.com/dirmacs/daedra)** — High-performance web search and research MCP server (DuckDuckGo-powered).

We run **Doltdot** — our AI agent — on top of this stack. It's live, it's working for us, and it's how we dogfood our own infrastructure every day.

## Vision

We're building AGI-approved infrastructure — automating startup, software development, and research in the open. Rust-first, agentic, and built to last. We're accelerating with a mini AGI system that runs 24/7, and we're here to share the journey with ambition and humility. DIRMACS exists to push what's possible when you combine open-source rigor, long-horizon thinking, and a team that ships.
