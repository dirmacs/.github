# DIRMACS

**Democratizing Innovation through Resource Mobility and Access Creation for Sustainability** — building the future with AI-powered solutions.

## What we do

We build open-source Rust infrastructure for agentic AI: long-horizon workflows, systems that run 24/7, and a stack where the human in the loop, agents, tools, and skills work as one. We're not just chasing intelligence — we're building the infrastructure that builds itself.

## Projects

- **[ares](https://github.com/dirmacs/ares)** — Production-grade agentic chatbot server with multi-provider LLM support, tool calling, RAG, and MCP integration.
- **[thulp](https://github.com/dirmacs/thulp)** — Execution Context Engineering Platform for AI agents.
- **[daedra](https://github.com/dirmacs/daedra)** — High-performance web search and research MCP server (DuckDuckGo-powered).
- **[doltares](https://github.com/dirmacs/doltares)** — Rust server that powers Doltdot (the DIRMACS AI agent): Leptos UI, workflows, scheduler, channel gateway, self-healing, and DAG orchestration.

## Vision

We're building AGI-approved infrastructure — automating startup, software development, and research in the open. Rust-first, agentic, and built to last. We're accelerating with a mini AGI system that runs 24/7, and we're here to share the journey with ambition and humility.
