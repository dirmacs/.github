# DIRMACS

Open-source Rust infrastructure for agentic AI. We build it, we run it, we ship it.

---

## What we do

We write Rust. We build the servers, the execution engines, and the search layers that let AI agents actually do work — not just talk. Long-horizon DAG workflows. Systems that run 24/7. Infrastructure that builds itself.

The human stays in the loop. The agent does the heavy lifting. Tools, skills, memory, and the human — all of it works as one system.

## Open-source projects

- **[ares](https://github.com/dirmacs/ares)** — Agentic chatbot server. Multi-provider LLM, tool calling, RAG, MCP.
- **[thulp](https://github.com/dirmacs/thulp)** — Execution Context Engineering Platform for AI agents.
- **[daedra](https://github.com/dirmacs/daedra)** — Web search and research MCP server. Fast, Rust, DuckDuckGo-powered.
- **[doltares](https://github.com/dirmacs/doltares)** — Rust server that powers Doltdot: Leptos UI, workflows, scheduler, channel gateway, self-healing, DAG.

We run **Doltdot** — our own AI agent — on top of this stack. It's live, it works, and it's how we dogfood everything we build.

## Where we're headed

AGI-approved infrastructure. We're not waiting for AGI to show up — we're building the stack it'll need when it does. Automating startup, software development, research. Rust-first, agentic, built to last. We're accelerating with a mini AGI system that runs 24/7 and we're doing it in the open.
